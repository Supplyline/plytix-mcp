# AGENT.md

This file exists for AI assistants that look for `AGENT.md` by convention (Cursor, Codex, Copilot, etc.).

**All project guidance is maintained in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** — please refer to that file for:

- Build & test commands
- Project structure
- Code organization guidelines (generic vs Supplyline-specific)
- Environment variables
- Architecture notes

The instructions in CLAUDE.md are not Claude-specific and apply to any AI coding assistant.
